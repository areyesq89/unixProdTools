## Terminal

![](https://wsvincent.com/assets/images/terminal-command-line-for-beginners/matrix.gif)

## Terminal (real life)

It is a text-only interface to interact with a computer. It receives standard input from a user and provides a standard output and standard error. 

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/Stdstreams-notitle.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Opening the terminal (MAC OS)

- Spotlight Search
- Type "terminal" -> Press enter

```bash
echo 'Hello world!'
```

## How to find commands?

The best way to find a command is to use Google. It is nothing to be ashamed of, programmers do it all the time. For example, if we forgot the name of the `echo` command, we could google it:

- "How to write output in the linux terminal?"

Look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluANRwPyNo

## Passing parameters and arguments

Typically, linux commands contain three parts the command, parameters passed via a "-" and the argument. 

```bash
echo -n 'Hello word!'
```

In this example, `echo` is the command, `-n` is the parameter and "Hello world" is the argument. 

## Looking for possible parameters

- Option A:

```bash
man echo
```

- Option B:

GOOGLE!!

## The "tab tab tab" trick

It is actually called autocomplete. It provides all possible options to complete your commands. 

```bash
ec
```

## "Finder" app using the terminal (I)

The print working directory command (`pwd`) returns the "current" location of the file system. By default, the terminal starts in your `home` directory. 

```bash
pwd
```

The list files (`ls`) command returns the names of all the files in the current directory:

```bash
ls
```

If we add the `-l` parameter to `ls`, it will provide a long and ordered version of `ls`.

```bash
ls -l
```

## "Finder" app using the terminal (II)

As in the "Finder" app, we can create new directories (i.e. folders) using the `mkdir` command. In general, life will be easier if we avoid special characters, **including spaces**!

```bash
mkdir Newdirectory
```

We can switch between directories using the change directory (`cd`) command.

```bash
cd Newdirectory
```

## Exercise I

What are the meanings of `.`, `..`, and `~`?

*Hint:* Run the `ls` command giving `.`, `..` and `~` as an argument. Alternatively, replace `ls` by `cd` and then run `pwd`.

## Wild cards (I)

There are three wild cards in linux `*`, `?` and `[]`. Lets prepare a small example in our directory `Newdirectory` to understand what these wildcards do. We will use the command `touch` to create three empty text files. 

```bash
cd ~
cd Newdirectory
touch bob.txt karla.txt kim.txt bib.txt
ls
```

## Wild cards (II)

- `*` represents zero or more characters 

```bash
ls k*
```

- `?` represents a single character

```bash
ls ???.txt
```

- `[]` represents a range of characters

```bash
ls 
ls b[io]b.txt
```

## Copying files

```
cd ~ 
cd Newdirectory
mkdir BNames
mkdir KNames
cp b* BNames
cp k* KNames
ls -l *Names
```

## Moving files

```
cd ~ 
cd Newdirectory
mkdir BNames
mkdir KNames
mv b* BNames
mv k* KNames
ls -l *Names
```
